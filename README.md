# Digital-Clock-and-Date
A very simple clock that also shows the date. 


I followed this turorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of3qzqAnJrI

I just added a few things onto it (Like the date) and a few other things like: changeing the background of the whole window so that adding new things wil be easier.

Feel free to do what ever you want with it.
